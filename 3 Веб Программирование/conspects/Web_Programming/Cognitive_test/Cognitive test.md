**Your Cognitive Profile**  
(brought to you by Dario Nardi PhD at Radiance House and keys2cognition.com)

**Understanding Your Results**

Your cognitive profile is presented below. It is based on how you rated described yourself. A 4-letter personality type code is also presented for your convenience if you are familiar with that framework. Most people find their results match their 4-letter personality type code. That is, we tend to develop and utilize what we prefer and vice versa. As you reflect on your cognitive profile, keep in mind that sometimes we develop a cognitive process to meet the demands of our environment or use a process well in one area of our lives but not others.

**The Eight Processes**

Swiss psychiatrist Dr. Carl Jung identified four mental functions. Today we know them as cognitive processes. We focus our attention and gather information using Sensing (S) and iNtuiting (N), and we organize our experiences and make decisions using Thinking (T) and Feeling (F). Jung described how each of these four processes plays out in a person's "internal world" (I) of thoughts, feelings, memories, and imagination; and in the "external world" (E) of actions, people, tools, and organizations. Thus, there are eight cognitive processes (Se, Si, Ne, Ni, Te, Ti, Fe, Fi).

**Basic and Developed Use**

Each cognitive process can be engaged in a basic, unsophisticated way reflecting our natural human capabilities. Almost everyone can engage each process in some basic way. We often do so every day. Beyond this, you will engage some cognitive processes in a more sophisticated, developed way. This is likely the result of innate preference plus lifelong growth and practice, which equals development.

**Judging — how we organize our experiences and make decisions**

Development is more than basic or advanced use of processes in isolation. We can talk about a spectrum. Wise use of a cognitive process involves both basic and advanced use, as appropriate, plus an ability to express other processes with it. Thus, visualizing a spectrum, "average" to "good" use usually means we can use the process in limited situations or use it well but only with the aid of other processes. In contrast, "poor" use means merely basic use or maybe inappropriate use. We may get into trouble when we neglect a process in our lives, if even with someone else's help.

**Your Cognitive Development Profile**

The forty-eight questions you rated earlier tap into the eight cognitive processes. Some questions tapped into basic or developed use of a process used by itself, while other questions tapped into use of multiple processes at once. The profile below is based on your responses. Length of the bars indicate strength of response. The equivalent numeric is shown along with likely level of development.

**Function Pairs**

We can look at pairs of functions, which tells us a lot about how a person operates overall in terms of information gathering (aka perception) and decision-making (aka judgment).

|   |   |   |   |
|---|---|---|---|
|Sensing-Thinking =|184|iNtuiting-Thinking =|185.9|
|Sensing-Feeling =|177.5|iNtuiting-Feeling =|179.4|

Your top function pair = NT

**Correlation to Personality Type**

By focusing on the strongest configuration of cognitive processes, your pattern of responses most closely matches individuals of the following 3 Myers-Briggs type codes (of 16 possible), in order of match:

1. **INTP**
2. **ENTP**
3. **ISTP**

These suggested types are calculated several ways. One way focuses on the first-ranked function and then considers a complementary second-ranked function. A second way focuses on function-pairings plus an overall bias toward extraverting or introverting. This allows for situations such as the dominant function not scoring first. A third way considers a runner-up result.

Ultimately, it is your responsibility to locate which type fits best. If these results here are different from what you know of yourself, you might consider why your developmental profile does not align with your expectation. You might also consider exploring the results here as a possible better fit.

**Aligning to Sixteen Patterns**

Jung observed that everyone has potential access to all eight cognitive processes but that we each prefer one as dominant — playing a lead role — with a second process playing a support role. Your two preferred cognitive processes allow you to do information gathering and decision making, introverting and extraverting. Maybe you prefer introverted Intuiting (Ni) in a lead role with extraverted Feeling (Fe) in a support role, which matches with INFJ preferences. Or maybe you prefer extraverted Sensing (Se) in a lead role with introverted Thinking (Ti) in a support role, which matches with ESTP preferences. Or maybe you prefer some other pairing. These pairings tap into sixteen possible balanced patterns which are often represented using a 4-letter code. Here are the sixteen type patterns and the preferred cognitive processes associated with each:

**Validity and Reliability of Results**

This assessment underwent rigorous development with over 3000 people, and recent further validation with almost 130,000 respondents confirms validity. We used various validation methods, namely latent class analysis (with Cronbach alpha >= 0.70). Over 95% of the time, the function pairing (ST, SF, NF, NT) is correct. Moreover, data analysis strongly supports key concepts including: basics vs advanced use, pairing of judging with perceiving for functional balance, and the polarities of Sensing vs iNtuiting and Thinking vs Feeling. You can consider your results here as valid as those from any professionally-developed assessment. You can read more here:

- [the 2006 white paper](https://www.keys2cognition.com/download-articles/Dev-Report-CPA.pdf), and
- [the 2021 white paper](https://www.keys2cognition.com/download-articles/Strong-Evidence-Jungs-8-Functions.pdf)

In the original study, people who took this assessment, and reported their 4-letter type code, received results that matched their type code 75% to 80% of the time. This is excellent performance since the reported type may be inaccurate even when "validated" or from a professional assessment. And even when the type code does not exactly match, the central functional pair (e.g. SF, ST, NF, NT) matches 95% of the time.

**Clarifying Your Result**

What if the 4-letter code reported here is different from what you expected? Let's say that your type code result here is ESTP and the type you are familiar with for yourself is INTJ. Even though the type codes look quite different, you may have rated the cognitive processes for these two types rather closely. Also, keep in mind the cognitive profile is based on your responses. Continuing with the example, if you didn't think of yourself as an ESTP, then you would reflect on why you rated highly a phrase such as "freely follow your gut instincts and exciting physical impulses as they come up." This phrase clearly does not fit with the INTJ type pattern. Please visit [www.bestfittype.com](http://www.bestfittype.com/) for more information and exploration.
